# Universal Item Manager (UIM) Business Model

## Overview
UIM is designed as an open-source protocol for cross-game NFT management, with a sustainable revenue model based on protocol fees and premium services. This document outlines the business model, revenue streams, and token economics that support long-term development and community growth.

## Protocol Fee Structure

### 1. Core Transaction Fees
Core transaction fees are implemented through smart contracts and represent the baseline revenue stream for the protocol.

| Transaction Type | Fee Structure | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| NFT-for-NFT Trades | Free | Direct item swaps to encourage adoption |
| NFT-to-Token Trades | 0.5% | When NFTs are sold for tokens |
| Escrow-based Trades | 2% | Secure trades with time-lock |
| Clan Multisig Transactions | 2% | Group-based transfers |
| Automated Merchant Sales | 3% | AI-powered automatic selling |

#### Fee Implementation Details
```solidity
contract UIMTrading {
    uint256 public constant NFT_TO_TOKEN_FEE = 50; // 0.5%
    uint256 public constant ESCROW_SERVICE_FEE = 200; // 2%
    uint256 public constant MULTISIG_FEE = 200; // 2%
    uint256 public constant MERCHANT_FEE = 300; // 3%
    
    function tradeNFTforNFT(
        address nft1Contract,
        uint256 nft1Id,
        address nft2Contract,
        uint256 nft2Id
    ) external {
        // Direct NFT-NFT trade - No fees
        _executeNFTTrade(msg.sender, nft1Contract, nft1Id, nft2Contract, nft2Id);
    }
    
    function tradeNFTforTokens(
        address nftContract,
        uint256 nftId,
        uint256 tokenAmount
    ) external {
        uint256 fee = (tokenAmount * NFT_TO_TOKEN_FEE) / 10000;
        _executeTokenTrade(msg.sender, nftContract, nftId, tokenAmount, fee);
    }
}
```

### 2. Premium Services
Subscription-based features implemented through smart contracts with time-locked access tokens.

| Service Tier | Monthly Fee (USD) | Features |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Basic | Free | - Basic inventory management<br>- P2P NFT-for-NFT trades<br>- World ID verification |
| Pro | $20 | - Advanced analytics<br>- Escrow trading<br>- Trading history<br>- Priority support |
| Enterprise | Custom | - Custom integration support<br>- Dedicated account manager<br>- White-label solutions |

### 3. Integration Revenue
Revenue sharing agreements with third-party integrations.

| Integration Type | Revenue Share | Implementation |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Marketplace Integration | 0.1-0.3% | Smart contract fee splitting |
| Game Developer SDK | License fee + 1% | Annual license + transaction fees |
| API Access | Usage-based | Pay-per-call model |

## Revenue Distribution Model

### Smart Contract Implementation
```solidity
contract UIMTreasury {
    // Revenue distribution percentages
    uint256 public constant PROTOCOL_TREASURY = 40;
    uint256 public constant STAKING_REWARDS = 30;
    uint256 public constant DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM = 20;
    uint256 public constant COMMUNITY_GROWTH = 10;
    
    // Distribution function called on fee collection
    function distributeRevenue(uint256 amount) public {
        uint256 protocolShare = (amount * PROTOCOL_TREASURY) / 100;
        uint256 stakingShare = (amount * STAKING_REWARDS) / 100;
        uint256 developerShare = (amount * DEVELOPER_ECOSYSTEM) / 100;
        uint256 communityShare = (amount * COMMUNITY_GROWTH) / 100;
        
        // Transfer to respective wallets/contracts
        _transferToProtocolTreasury(protocolShare);
        _distributeStakingRewards(stakingShare);
        _transferToDeveloperPool(developerShare);
        _transferToCommunityPool(communityShare);
    }
}
```
